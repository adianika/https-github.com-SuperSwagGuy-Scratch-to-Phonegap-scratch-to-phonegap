 Control Justin with the arrow keys. Justin walks on dirt (brown) and bounces on trampolines (green), but whatever you do, don't touch the black blocks (not to be racist or anything).

Features:
-Play as Justin and run, jump, climb, and bounce your way to victory
-Cut scenes!!!
-A lit soundtrack, none of which is copyrighted ;) 
-5 worlds and 3 boss levels based on Mega Owchies The Movie
-Self Destruct Sequence!
